PetMate: Your Pet's Pocket Care Buddy
PetMate is an iOS application designed to help pet owners easily track and manage their pet's daily care routines. Never forget a task again and ensure your furry, scaly, or feathered friends are always happy and well-cared for!

🐾 The Problem
Caring for pets is rewarding, but remembering every single task, every single day, can be a challenge. Feeding times, walks, grooming, playtime – these small, yet crucial, tasks often go untracked, leading to missed routines and potential gaps in your pet's well-being.
